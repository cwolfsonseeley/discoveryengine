# discoveryengine 0.1.5.9001

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

## Bugs

* Add error-checking on argument names: @datalover916 noticed that `in_development_officer_portfolio(1234, include_inactive = TRUE, include_active = FALSE)` did not result in an error (but also did not result in what you would expect if you typed that). All widgets now check argument names to make sure there aren't any (#21). 

## New Widgets:
* `fund_department`
* `contact_unit`
* `has_gift_planning_score` (#17, @datalover916)
* `in_development_officer_portfolio` (#19, L.C.)
* `works_in_industry`
* `has_occupation`
* `has_record_type` (tarakc02/getcdw#8, @datalover916)

## brainstorm_bot
`brainstorm_bot` now searches MSAs. This may slow down its performance.
